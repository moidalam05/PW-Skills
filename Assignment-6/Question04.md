# Q4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS?

Ans: - 5 Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems Tackled by DBMS:

1. Data Redundancy: File-based storage systems often lead to data redundancy, as the same data may be duplicated across multiple files. DBMS eliminates this issue by enforcing data integrity and ensuring that each piece of data is stored only once.

2. Data Inconsistency: Maintaining data consistency across multiple files can be challenging in a file-based storage system. DBMS addresses this challenge by providing features like transactions and referential integrity constraints, which help maintain data consistency even during concurrent access and updates.

3. Lack of Data Integration: File-based storage systems typically lack the ability to integrate data from different sources. DBMS overcomes this challenge by providing data integration capabilities, allowing users to combine data from various sources into a single, cohesive view.

4. Limited Scalability: File-based storage systems can struggle to scale as the amount of data grows. DBMS is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring scalability and performance even as the data size increases.

5. Complex Data Management: Managing large numbers of files and directories in a file-based storage system can be complex and time-consuming. DBMS simplifies data management by providing a centralized platform to store, organize, and access data, making it easier for users and applications to interact with the data.

Additionally, DBMS offers several other benefits over file-based storage systems, including robust security mechanisms, data backup and recovery capabilities, built-in data analysis tools, and support for concurrent access and transactions. These features enable organizations to manage their data more effectively, improve data accuracy and consistency, enhance security, and gain valuable insights through data analysis.
