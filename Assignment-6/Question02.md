# Q2. Write a short note on file based storage system. Explain the major challenges of a file based storage system ?

Ans: - A file-based storage system is a traditional method of storing data in separate files, each of which contains a collection of related information. Each file is identified by a unique name and can be accessed independently of other files.

## Major Challenges of a File-Based Storage System -

1. Data Redundancy: File-based storage systems often lead to data redundancy, as the same data may be duplicated across multiple files, resulting in wasted storage space and inconsistencies.

2. Data Inconsistency: Maintaining data consistency across multiple files can be challenging, especially in environments where multiple users or applications access and modify the same data concurrently.

3. Lack of Data Integration: File-based storage systems typically lack the ability to integrate data from different sources, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of all available information.

4. Limited Scalability: File-based storage systems can struggle to scale as the amount of data grows, leading to performance issues and increased management complexity.

5. Data Security: File-based storage systems often lack built-in security features, making it more difficult to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or breaches.

6. Complex Data Management: Managing large numbers of files and directories can be complex and time-consuming, especially in large-scale environments.

7. Data Recovery: Recovering data from a file-based storage system can be challenging, especially if the files are corrupted or accidentally deleted.

8. Lack of Data Analysis Capabilities: File-based storage systems typically lack built-in data analysis capabilities, making it difficult to extract insights and make informed decisions based on the stored data.
